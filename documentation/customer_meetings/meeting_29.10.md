- Or use some kind of code to create gamemaster accounts
  - For creating batches of accounts without having to do each manually
- Admins would have control of gamemaster and other admin accounts
  - Being able to manage permissions and other stuff
- If everyone on a team can use their computer to view their board maybe only one person has control it so that collaboration is still important
- Make timer customization in hostgame screen
- Customers make different value coins for different energy costs
