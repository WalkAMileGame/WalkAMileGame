# Customer meeting 26.11.2025

Notes:
- Ability to minimize circumstance card
- Instructions on how to operate the board. Like how to rotate or zoom or pan
- Change the color or wording of the start circle. Arrows from the center outwards
- Comparison: option with two boards side by side was best, circumstances should be visible
- What should be highlighted in comparison: show the bare minimum by fading out non-essential tiles.
- Guiding questions at the end of the game, customer has written questions
- Energy coins are fine
- Board and circumstance visibility: gamemasters can only see their own items and defaults
- New icons for dashboard etc. (Remember to put assets in database)
- Customers have SSL certificate questions for M. Luukkainen or tech support
- Gamedev’s idea: different colors reflect energy price
- Customer provided about us and will provide mandatory labels
- Next meeting: 10.12.2025
