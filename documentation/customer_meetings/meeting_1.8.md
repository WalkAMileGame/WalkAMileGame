# Customer Meeting 1.8 

- What messaging service will we use with the customer
    - How will we communicate
    - Do they have input on the sprint
- What are the rules for the game
    - How many players
    - How will it work with multiple different games for different countries
- How modifiable does the game have to be
    - How will it have to be modified for different versions
- What kind of app is wanted
    - Web app or something else
    - What kind of user interface
- How is the game played
    - Does the customer want login
- What are the first priorities to begin with
    - Do they want functionality or just documentation



- Wednesday is meeting day 17.9 12:00 o clock
- There should be an admin
- Microsoft teams for communication
- Game is in english documentation as well

- Multiple teams upwards of 12
    - Teams have their own unique modifier
    - Lots of players upwards of 60 people
- No rule book yet but some rules in a slide
- The game is played in a get together group not with randoms
    - One person makes the game and invites others
    - Played on one singular board
    - Each team has their own board
- Board modification has some constants some could change
    - Could just change the names to create “skins” for different locales
- Keep the code abstract and flexible since the rules could change drastically during development
- 32 energy points, could change
    - Figure out what combination of points where give you the most energy to put into thriving (the third and outer most ring)
    - Different playable spots can give different effect such as making other things cheaper or more expensive
- the game is finished after some time (30 min right now) experience not win
    - After the game is finished there should be an overview of how the game went
    - The teams can then compare boards and see what others did
    - They would also see what mistakes they made what rules they broke etc
    - Getting energy in thriving is the closest thing to a score of how well you did
- The order of placing energy probably should matter to model the real world more closely



IMPORTANT
The game is supposed to be confusing and part of the experience is figuring out what you're supposed to do
Communicating with your team is important
The point of the game isn't to win
